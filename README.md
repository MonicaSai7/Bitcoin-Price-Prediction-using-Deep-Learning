# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning

This project is implementation of a paper "Project Based Learning: Predicting Bitcoin Prices using Deep Learning" presented in 2019 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) by students of Amity University, Dubai.

This paper interested me as it combines two major domains in one use case, that is, deep learning for predicting Bitcoin prices. As a beginner to deep learning I take up this as an exploratory project to expand my knowledge on Convolution Neural Networks and other techniques in deep learning.

In this project machine-learning algorithms will be used for predicting changes in Bitcoin prices in the short run, from historical time series data of quantitative factors that affect Bitcoin prices. The concept is to implement a system capable of analysing real time data and give a sense of direction to investors to help in decision making. The application will take in real world data and will go through a series of data reshaping which will get the data ready to be fed into the machine learning algorithms. Using this data, the model will be able to predict the Bitcoin price of tomorrow.
